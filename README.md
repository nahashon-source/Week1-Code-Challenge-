The projects include a Speed Detector, a Student Grade Generator, and a Net Salary Calculator. Each application demonstrates how to handle user input, perform calculations, and display results.

## Speed Detector
The Speed Detector application evaluates the speed of a vehicle and calculates demerit points based on the speed input. It uses JavaScript to handle user input and apply conditional logic to determine if the speed is within the limit or if demerit points should be assigned. To use the application, ensure Node.js is installed on your machine, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run node speed_detector.js. Enter the speed of the vehicle when prompted, and the application will display the result.

## Student Grade Generator
The Student Grade Generator application prompts the user to input student marks and generates the corresponding grade. The grading system is based on predefined ranges, and the application uses JavaScript to handle user input and perform the necessary calculations. To use the application, ensure Node.js is installed, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run node student_grade_generator.js. Enter the student's marks when prompted, and the application will display the grade.

## Net Salary Calculator
The Net Salary Calculator application calculates the net salary after deductions such as PAYE (Pay As You Earn), NHIF (National Hospital Insurance Fund), and NSSF (National Social Security Fund). It uses JavaScript to handle user input, perform financial calculations, and display the results. To use the application, ensure Node.js is installed, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run node net_salary_calculator.js. Enter your basic salary and the amount you receive in benefits when prompted, and the application will display your gross salary, PAYE, NHIF, NSSF, and net salary.
